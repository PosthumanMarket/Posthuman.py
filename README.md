# Posthuman : Ocean Marketplace for Pretrained Transformer Models

please refer to branch **v0.3** and v1 for latest code and README.

Posthuman Marketplace is a fork of the ocean marketplace, aimed at the following functionality:
1. Verifiably Training, Evaluating, and utilising models in Zero-Knowledge using Compute-to-Data
2. Reward contributors to training to incentivise large-scale federated training.

Posthuman Marketplace contracts are currently deployed on Rinkerby. The code is complete for the above functionality. Additional functionality will be added in the next two months.

Refer to the following files for a demonstration of the functionality:

Custom_Marketplace_flow: Demonstrates how a consumer (Bob) can train and use the model in zero knowledge using datatokens and computute to data. [Rinkerby]

Custom_Reward_Mechanism: shows how a trainer (Charlie) can get rewarded PH coins for improving the loss score. PH coins will eventually be bought back with a share of marketplace revenue, giving them value. [Rinkerby]

Computing Cluster:
We've set up a V100 GPU based kubernetes cluster for optimial efficiency in training and inference from large transformers. We will eventually expand this to 100s of GPUs to support GPT-3 scale models.

Algorithims:
We've included versatile training, evaluation, and inference algorithims from huggingface for use on our marketplace. Small modifications to these templates will cover virtually all transformer fine-tuning and inference use cases.



# ocean-lib

`ocean-lib` is a Python library to privately & securely publish, exchange, 
and consume data. With it, you can:
* **Publish** data services: downloadable files or compute-to-data. 
Ocean creates a new [ERC20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/7f4f0377730f5fc266824084188cc17cf246932e/EIPS/eip-20.md) 
datatoken for each data set.
* **Mint** datatokens to allow buying/consuming the data service
* **Consume** datatokens, to access the service
* **Transfer** datatokens to another owner, and **all other ERC20 actions** 
using [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html#working-with-an-erc20-token-contract) etc.
* **Price** datatokens in terms of OCEAN tokens by creating a Balancer pool of `datatoken <> OCEAN`
* **Stake** OCEAN tokens on specific datatokens (by adding OCEAN liquidity into a datatoken Balancer pool)
* Buy datatokens from available Balancer pools or from fixed price exchange if available
* And much more ...


`ocean-lib` is part of the [Ocean Protocol](https://www.oceanprotocol.com) toolset.

## Quick Install

```pip install ocean-lib```

## Quickstart

### 1. Basic setup

[Use this guide](READMEs/setup.md) to connect to Ethereum network and Ocean service providers, configure your Ethereum account / private key, and publish your very first datatoken.

### 2. Get an overview of ocean-lib

[Here's](READMEs/overview.md) a short description of key ocean-lib modules and functions.

### 3. Quickstart marketplace flow

[This quickstart](READMEs/marketplace_flow.md) describes how to publish data assets as datatokens (including metadata), post the datatokens to a marketplace, buy datatokens, and consume datatokens (including download).
